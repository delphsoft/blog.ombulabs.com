The other day a friend of mine reported a vulnerability in the [Almundo](http://almundo.com/) billing system. Since then, the vulnerability has been fixed by [Superfactura](http://superfactura.com.ar/), their billing software provider.

The vulnerability allowed anyone to download billing information about their clients by creating a pretty simple `HTTP GET` request. No programming knowledge required.

Basically, if you had bought anything from Almundo, you would have received an email with a link to your bill. Something like this: [http://asatej.superfactura.com.ar/un_comprobante_pdf.php?s=1&f=73455&tc=F13&tf=B](http://asatej.superfactura.com.ar/un_comprobante_pdf.php?s=1&f=73455&tc=F13&tf=B)

At plain sight, you can see the type of bill (*Factura B*) and the number of bill (*Factura #73455*)

By entering this URL, you could see sensitive information about the client and what they had bought:

* Client's full name
* Client's CUIL (Tax identification number in Argentina)
* Client's address
* What they bought. For example: **EZEPUJEZE** for a flight ticket from **Ezeiza** (Buenos Aires, Argentina) to **Punta Cana** (MÃ©xico)
* How much they paid

Fortunately, you couldn't see when this trip was happening.

During the many days that this vulnerability was on production, someone with some programming knowledge could have created a script that iterated from 1 to 10000 (for the bill number) and from A to C (for the bill type) sending GET requests and downloading all the billing information from Almundo.

Considering that [Superfactura](http://superfactura.com.ar/) has a few clients, we can only assume that this vulnerability was also in production for all of their clients.
